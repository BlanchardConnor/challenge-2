# Development Portfolio

 - - - -

## User Story
```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

### Description
This is my current working version of a web development portfolio. It still needs to be improved upon, which I am planning to do over the course of the next few months as I learn more.

### Tasks Completed
* Created a working HTML file with a topnav
* Created a second HTML file for my "About" page
* Created CSS file, and stylized both HTML files
* Checked that all links included on both pages function properly

### Usage
Once the link is deployed, the website can be viewed in a traditional desktop browser.
